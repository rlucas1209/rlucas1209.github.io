          <h1>About Me</h1>
         My name is Lucas Rocha and I'm from Milford, Massacusetts. In highschool I played basketball, football, and I ran track. I chose the major Computer Science
        to able to master coding and other things to get a job in that field in the future. So far this class has been my favorite, and I'm sure it'l stay that way.
